## About Me  

I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Arnaout Lab](https://arnaoutlab.org/) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where I work on machine learning, especially as applied in a medical context.

In May 2021 I earned my Ph.D. in physics from the University of Texas at Austin, where I worked with the  [Weinberg Theory Group](https://zippy.ph.utexas.edu/) on the AdS/CFT correspondence and its intersection with quantum information.
