## About Me  

I am a postdoctoral research fellow in the computer science department at Boston College, where I study graph matching.

In May 2021 I earned my Ph.D. in physics from the University of Texas at Austin, where I worked with the  [Weinberg Theory Group](https://zippy.ph.utexas.edu/) on the AdS/CFT correspondence and its intersection with quantum information.
